# suckless
### Personnal forks of some suckless.org & related packages I use (dwm, st, slstatus ...).

Not much of interest here, except maybe for the updated 6.1-singularborders patch. Beware tho, as I did the patch against an unclean, already patched dwm. As far as I tried it, it works against clean dwm-6.1 sources.
